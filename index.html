        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            You have come into possession of a Farpatch DVT7 board. Congratulations! This is one of 50 boards produced,
            and is designed to provide final testing before production.
        <p>
            This board has the following features:
        <ul>
            <li>10-pin Cortex debug header (1.27mm pitch)</li>
            <li>Buck-boost capable of powering off 1.8V - 5V</li>
            <li>Level shifters for working across the entire power range</li>
            <li>2.4 GHz Wifi, powered by an ESP32-C6</li>
            <li>16 MB SPI flash</li>
            <li>Software powered by Farpatch and the Black Magic Debug project</li>
            <li>USB-C connection for development</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Modifying the case</h3>
        <p>
            The case requires slightly modification to work with the wifi antenna.
        <p>
            To use the case, use a knife to chip away a bit of the material. This will be used to allow the wifi antenna
            to escape the case once connected.

        <h3>Setup</h3>
        <p>
            To set up the board, connect the supplied wifi antenna. Note that U.Fl connectors need a lot of force. Make
            sure you don't bend the metalic shell while connecting it! Once attached, angle the antenna so that it goes
            out over the USB connector.
        <p>
            Finally, connect Farpatch to a debug target with a standard 10-pin Cortex debug cable. The red LED will turn
            on, indicating that Farpatch is running.

        <h3>Conencting to Farpatch</h3>
        <p>
            Each Farpatch device has a unique name. This name is derived from the MAC address of the ESP32-C6. When you
            first connect Farpatch, it will start an access point. This will be named using a format of
            <code>Farpatch (word1 word2)</code>. By default, there is no password.
        <p>
            You can connect to Farpatch by going to <code>http://10.10.0.1</code>, or using mDNS you can go to
            <code>http://farpatch-word1-word2.local</code>.

        <h3>Configuring Farpatch</h3>
        <p>
            To configure Farpatch, go to its web interface and select "Settings". There is a section titled "Wifi
            Client", which will contain a list of locally-discovered access points. You can connect to an access point
            using this list.

        <p>
            Farpatch supports multiple access points. Additionally, it supports acting as both an access point itself,
            as well as a wifi client. You can improve performance by unchecking the "Enabled" box under "AP Mode".
            <strong>Note that Farpatch will always start an AP if it is unable to connect to an access point.</strong>

        <h3>Using Farpatch</h3>
        <p>
            Farpatch starts a GDB server on port 2022. You can start a GDB session by running
            <code>arm-none-eabi-gdb</code> and connecting to the target with
            <code>target ext farpatch-word1-word2.local:2022</code>. You can then use this like a standard Black Magic
            Device.

        <p>
            For example, run <code>mon s</code> to scan for SWD devices, then run <code>att 1</code> to attach to the
            first discovered device. Alternately, run <code>mon j</code> to perform a JTAG scan.

        <p>
            Farpatch also supports RTT. An RTT interface is available via the web interface, or you can telnet to port
            2123.

        <h3>Serial Connection</h3>
        <p>
            Farpatch supports the Universal Uart standard. This places UART communication signals on pins 7 and 9 of the
            debug header. If your target has a Universal UART, then you can use Farpatch to communicate with the target
            over serial.

        <h3>Developing for Farpatch</h3>
        <p>
            The firmware for Farpatch is written using ESP-IDF. To develop for Farpatch, perform the following actions:

        <ol>
            <li>Download the esp-idf main branch:<br />
                <code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git</code>
            </li>
            <li>Install the dependencies:<br /><code>cd esp-idf; ./install.sh</code></li>
            <li>Set up the environment:<br /><code>. export.sh</code></li>
            <li>Clone Farpatch:<br /><code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/farpatch/farpatch.git</code>
            </li>
            <li>Configure Farpatch and set DVT7 as the hardware:<br />
                <code>cd farpatch; idf.py set-target esp32c6; idf.py menuconfig</code>
            </li>
            <li>Build Farpatch:<br /><code>idf.py build</code></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            You can then flash <code>build/farpatch.bin</code> using the built-in UI, or via TFTP. The web interface
            will roll back
            the update if it fails to stay running for more than a few seconds in order to protect against invalid
            firmware images.

        <p>
            Alternately, you can plug Farpatch into a USB-C connection and develop that way. For example:
            <code>idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbmodem* build flash monitor</code>

        <p>
            It is possible to power Farpatch from USB-C or from the target -- it will draw power from whichever has the
            higher voltage.

        <h3>A Note about Low Voltages</h3>
        <p>
            Farpatch is designed to work down to 1.8 volts, however the nature of wifi means that there are very high
            current transients. As a result, lower voltage power supplies may not be able to supply enough power for
            transmitting, particularly at high power.

        <p>
            This is an ongoing area of research. There is an option to enable low power mode and limit the transmit
            power to 10 dBm. The ESP-IDF function <a
                href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3.2/esp32/api-reference/network/esp_wifi.html#_CPPv425esp_wifi_set_max_tx_power6int8_t"><code>esp_wifi_set_max_tx_power(int8_t power)</code></a>
            is potentially useful in determining an acceptable transmit power level, particularly if we measure the
            voltage droop of the main voltage supply. However, this is a work in progress.
